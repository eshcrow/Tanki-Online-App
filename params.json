You can ask me for a favor to send you the .gmz file if you need it...\r\nIf you have any questions, or just want to join the development, don´t be so shy and contact me using e-mail address: developer344@gmail.com\r\nFeel free to ask me on anything about the project, and I hope you will rate it! It´s still in development, but I hope it will be used by many tankists out there!\r\nMy primary task is to make the app as User-Friendly as possible. It will be used to test your ping to tankionline.com servers, but also a good info getter to get some info about Hulls and Turrets, even in offline mode!\r\nAlso, my extra task is to make a brand-new Tanki Online Launcher, from where you can launch the app with informations, testing ping, launching Tanki Online, reading news, watching V-Logs, and even trying your Keyboard Sensitivity to make sure you can use your keyboard in the battle!\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this is really hard work for single person to make a HUGE APP for everyone with LOTS, LOTS of features!\r\nI hope you will collaborate with me on my big project, help me get some assets to make the app grow bigger and better, write me some ideas, or just make me a big motivation!\r\n\r\nLots of greetings, guys!\r\n\r\nDeveloper.exe\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
