<p>This is the whole code for Tanki Online App. Also, it includes resources used in that application.
As you can see, It´s developed using GML Language with .gmx format. You can ask me for a favor to send you the .gmz file if you need it...
If you have any questions, or just want to join the development, don´t be so shy and contact me using e-mail address: <a href="mailto:developer344@gmail.com">developer344@gmail.com</a>
Feel free to ask me on anything about the project, and I hope you will rate it! It´s still in development, but I hope it will be used by many tankists out there!
My primary task is to make the app as User-Friendly as possible. It will be used to test your ping to tankionline.com servers, but also a good info getter to get some info about Hulls and Turrets, even in offline mode!
Also, my extra task is to make a brand-new Tanki Online Launcher, from where you can launch the app with informations, testing ping, launching Tanki Online, reading news, watching V-Logs, and even trying your Keyboard Sensitivity to make sure you can use your keyboard in the battle!</p>

<p>As you can see, this is really hard work for single person to make a HUGE APP for everyone with LOTS, LOTS of features!
I hope you will collaborate with me on my big project, help me get some assets to make the app grow bigger and better, write me some ideas, or just make me a big motivation!</p>

<p>Lots of greetings, guys!</p>
